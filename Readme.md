üèÜ Project Title: Autonome Categorizer (AutoCat)
Theme: Automated AI-Based Financial Transaction Categorisation
1. üí° Project Overview & MotivationThis project addresses the critical need for a cost-effective, in-house Machine Learning solution to automatically classify raw financial transaction strings (e.g., "Starbucks," "Amazon.com") into meaningful, configurable categories (e.g., "Coffee/Dining," "Shopping").By building an internal system, we eliminate reliance on expensive, external APIs, providing developers with full control, low latency, and customisability over their financial data taxonomy.Core Goal: Build a standalone classification system achieving a Macro F1-score of $\ge 0.90$ on a customisable category set.
2. üöÄ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to set up the project environment and generate the required data.
  2.1. PrerequisitesYou must have Python 3.9+ installed.
  2.2. Environment SetupClone the repository:Bash  git clone [your-repo-link]
  cd [YourHackathonProject]
  Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended): python -m venv venv
  # On Windows:
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  # On macOS/Linux:
  source venv/bin/activate
  Install dependencies: pip install pandas scikit-learn faker
3. üíæ Data Generation (Phase 1 Deliverable)Since no official dataset was provided, we generated a synthetic, robust dataset based on a custom, configurable taxonomy.
  3.1. Taxonomy ConfigurationThe target categories and their associated training keywords are defined in the configuration file:taxonomy.json: This file defines the full category set and is the key mechanism for meeting the Customisable requirement. Developers can edit this file to change the classification schema without touching the ML code.
  3.2. ExecutionThe synthetic data is generated by running the generate_data.py script. This script handles:Loading keywords from taxonomy.json.Adding realistic noise (POS IDs, dates, prefixes) to simulate real-world transaction strings, addressing the Robustness requirement.Splitting the final dataset into three sets using stratified sampling.To generate the data:Bash# Ensure you have created the output directory:
  mkdir data
  # Run the generator:
  python generate_data.py
3.3. Data OutputThe script generates the following files in the /data/ directory, ensuring a clean separation for rigorous evaluation
