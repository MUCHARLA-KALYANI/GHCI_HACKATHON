# 🏆 Project Title: **Autonome Categorizer (AutoCat)**

### Theme: Automated AI-Based Financial Transaction Categorisation

---

## 💡 1. Project Overview & Motivation

**Autonome Categorizer (AutoCat)** is an **AI-powered, in-house Machine Learning system** designed to automatically classify raw financial transaction strings (e.g., `"Starbucks"`, `"Amazon.com"`) into meaningful and configurable categories such as `"Coffee/Dining"` or `"Shopping"`.

This project addresses a key challenge in modern financial applications — the **dependence on costly, third-party APIs** for transaction categorization. Such APIs often lead to:

* High scaling and subscription costs
* Increased latency
* Limited flexibility and customization

**AutoCat** eliminates these issues by providing a **standalone, low-latency, and fully customizable** categorization engine that can be integrated into any financial platform.

### 🎯 Core Objective

Build a **scalable, explainable, and standalone classification system** that achieves a **Macro F1-score ≥ 0.90** on a **customizable set of transaction categories**, defined dynamically via configuration files.

## ⚙️ 2. Setup and Installation

Follow the steps below to set up your local environment and generate the required synthetic dataset.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

* Python **3.9+** must be installed on your system.

### 2.2. Environment Setup

Clone the repository and set up your environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-link]
cd [YourHackathonProject]
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn faker
```

## 💾 3. Data Generation (Phase 1 Deliverable)

Since no official dataset was provided, **AutoCat** includes a **synthetic data generation pipeline** to create a realistic, diverse dataset for model training and evaluation.

### 3.1. Taxonomy Configuration

All target categories and their associated training keywords are defined in the configuration file:

📄 **`taxonomy.json`**

This file defines:

* The complete category set
* Example merchant keywords for each category

It serves as the **central configuration mechanism**, allowing developers to easily modify the category schema **without editing any ML code** — directly satisfying the *Customisability* requirement.

---

### 3.2. Data Generation Execution

The synthetic dataset can be generated using the `generate_data.py` script.

This script:

* Loads keywords and category mappings from **`taxonomy.json`**
* Adds **realistic noise** (POS IDs, random dates, transaction suffixes, etc.) to simulate **real-world transaction variability**, ensuring robustness
* Performs **stratified train/validation/test splits** for reproducible evaluation

To generate data, run:

```bash
# Create the output directory if not present
mkdir data

# Run the data generator
python generate_data.py
```

---

### 3.3. Output Structure

The generated files will be stored in the **`/data/`** directory, ensuring a clean separation between datasets for transparent evaluation.

```
/data
 ├── train.csv      # Training data
 ├── val.csv        # Validation data
 └── test.csv       # Test data
```
